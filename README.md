# Self-Organized Distributed System for Deploying Connected UAV Networks

## Overview
VESPA (Vehicle Exploration using Self-organized Parallel Algorithm) is a distributed algorithm designed for autonomous UAV networks. This system allows drones to detect and cover targets in unknown locations, ensuring network connectivity to a central base (sink) in real-time disaster management scenarios.

VESPA leverages only one-hop information to dynamically adjust drone positions and connectivity, maintaining coverage while reducing drone count. It is optimized for search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and temporary network deployment in areas with limited ground access.

## Key Features
- **Distributed Target Detection**: Drones autonomously identify and cover targets within their range.
- **Dynamic Connectivity**: Ensures a continuous multi-hop path from each discovered target to the sink.
- **Adaptive Coverage**: The algorithm self-organizes drones to maximize coverage and adapt to new target discoveries.
- **Benchmarked Performance**: Outperforms the SaS (Spread and Shrink) algorithm in drone efficiency and coverage, discovering targets with up to 55% fewer drones.

## Running VESPA Simulation with a Specific Number of Drones
To execute the VESPA simulation, run the following script. It will create the build directory (if not already created), compile the code, execute it, and generate visualizations using Python.
```bash
    ./run.sh n=<number_of_drones> a=<communication_radius>
```
- `n`: Number of drones.
- `a`: Communication range between drones and their neighbors. If a is not specified, it defaults to 20.
Note: The targets are not shared among drones. Each drone will individually search for targets within its region after every movement.
The script will generate images for each stage of the simulation in the animation_result directory.
The script will prompt you to choose how to define the targets. There are two options:
#### 1. **Using Predefined Targets**: 
In this option, you can specify the number of targets you want and manually enter the coordinates (x, y) for each target.
#### 2. **Using Random Targets**: 
In this option, you can specify the number of targets, and the coordinates will be generated randomly.

# Benchmarks 

#### 1. **Determining the Number of Drones Needed for Fixed Pre-Defined Targets**
This benchmark will run multiple simulations to explore all possible configurations. To execute this separately:

```bash 
    ./run_benchmark.sh  pre_target 
```
The script will check if you want to adjust the Predefined Targets, the number of drones to test, and the number of runs (tries) for each number of drones. Since VESPA includes random processes, the coverage area may vary between runs.

#### 2. **Determining the Number of Drones Needed for Random Targets with Variable Quantities**
This benchmark tests configurations with random targets (e.g., 1-30 targets) across configurations for each target length. Run with:
```bash  
    ./run_benchmark.sh  rand_targets
```
The script will also prompt you to specify parameters for the simulation, such as the maximum number of targets, the number of configurations per target, and the maximum number of drones to test. You can choose to keep the default settings or modify them as needed.

Note: These random targets are generated by SAS simulation and saved in file in SAS directory since they need to be shared between SAS and VESPA simulation for comparison. 

### 3. **Complete Benchmark Comparison with [SAS](https://hal.univ-reunion.fr/hal-01406492v1)**

This benchmark compares the performance of the VESPA and SAS algorithms for both the predefined and random target cases:

```bash 
    ./run_benchmark.sh  all
```
Important: To run this benchmark, you need to have the SageMath library installed, as it is required for generating SAS data.
